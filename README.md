## Assessing the Impact of Hurricane Helene on River Dynamics in East Tennessee and Western North Carolina 

üèûÔ∏èThis project investigates the hydrological and geomorphological impacts of Hurricane Helene on major river systems in East Tennessee and Western North Carolina. The study focuses on pre- and post-flood conditions to understand changes in river dynamics, including water levels, flow velocity, and potential geomorphic changes.

### üó∫Ô∏è Study Area
The primary study area includes the basins of several key rivers:

Western North Carolina: French Broad River and its major tributary, the Swannanoa River, particularly in and around Asheville.

Eastern Tennessee: Nolichucky River, Upper French Broad River, and Pigeon River.

The study area encompasses the state boundary between Tennessee and North Carolina.

### üìÖ Data Collection Timeline
Data was collected in two primary phases:

Pre-Flood Data: Early to mid-September 2024 to establish baseline conditions.

Post-Flood Data: Late September to early October 2024 (specifically September 26-29 for peak flood and early October for post-flood conditions) to capture the impact of Hurricane Helene.

### üìä Datasets and Tools
A variety of datasets and tools were used to conduct the assessment:

Topographic Data:

Digital Elevation Models (DEMs): Downloaded from The National Map Downloader for detailed terrain analysis. These are crucial for hydrological modeling.

Hydrological Data:

USGS Gauge Station Data: Real-time and historical water level and flow data were retrieved from the USGS WaterWatch and specific gauge stations along the French Broad, Swannanoa, Nolichucky, and Pigeon rivers.

NHDPlus and SWORD Datasets: These datasets provide comprehensive information on stream networks, watersheds, and river attributes, which are essential for network analysis.

Land Cover and Landslide Data:

ESRI Land Cover (10 m): Used to understand the landscape characteristics and vegetation, which influence runoff and erosion.

Landslide Data: Acquired from the USGS Hurricane Helene Landslide Response - ScienceBase Catalog to assess the geomorphic impact and potential sediment transport into the river systems.

Transportation Data: Transportation layers were also used from The National Map to understand infrastructure vulnerability and connectivity within the study area.

Modeling Software:

HEC-RAS 2D Unsteady Flow: Utilized to simulate the flood event, model water surface elevations, and analyze flow velocities during the hurricane. This software helps visualize the extent of inundation and the dynamics of the floodwaters.

ArcGIS/ESRI Software: Employed for geospatial analysis, data visualization, and processing of various datasets.

### üìù Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:

To quantify the changes in river stage and discharge rates before, during, and after Hurricane Helene.

To map and analyze the extent of flooding and inundation in the study area.

To assess the impact of landslides on river sediment load and morphology.

To create a comprehensive report and visualizations detailing the hydrological and geomorphic impacts of the hurricane on the river systems.
